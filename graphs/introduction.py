# Where to use graphs: 
# Social networks, location, routing system, visual hierarchy, file system optimizations

# Essential graph terms:
# Vertex: a node
# Edge: a connection between nodes
# Weighted/ Unweighted: values assigned to distances between vertices
# Directed/ Undirected: directions assigned to distanced between vertices

# Type of graphs:
# Undirected graph, directed graph, unweighted graph, weighted graph

# Storing graphs: adjacency matrix, adjacency list
