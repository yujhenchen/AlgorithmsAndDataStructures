# Each parent has at most two child nodes
# The left and right node have no order
# A binary heap is as compact as possible.
# All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

# MaxBinaryHeap: parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
# MinBinaryHeap: parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
